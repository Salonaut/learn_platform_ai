"""
Permission tests for learning_plan app.

Currently, the app uses Django REST Framework's default permissions.
When custom permissions are added, tests should be added here.

Example test structure:
- Test IsOwner permission
- Test IsAuthenticated requirements
- Test view-level permissions

from django.test import TestCase

# Add permission tests here when custom permissions are implemented
